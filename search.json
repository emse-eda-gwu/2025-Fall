Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions in Slack, and try it again later.\nI promise, you can do this!",

Quizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz.\nQuizzes are short (10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.",

If you do AI tools on assignments in this class, you must include the prompt(s) you used as well as any changes made to get better results to receive full credit. I want to see how you are using them. Be transparent - that is all I ask.\nFor writing assistance, LLMs are again permitted, but again I want to see how you used them. If you used an LLM to help you with any of the writing portions of your assignments, include a section called “Use of AI on this assignment” and describe which tool(s) we used and how they were used.\nYour goal in using tools like ChatGPT should be to see them as an assistant - a tool to help you accomplish the task - rather than as a solutions manual. Take the time to work through the code / text these tools generate and ensure that what they provide is accurate, and if not make the corrections to fix their mistakes.\n\nCurious how LLMs actually work? Check out this article, which provides a simplified description of how they work (which itself is still quite complicated).",

Penalties are decided by the course instructors, and can vary based on the severity of the offense. Possible penalties include:\n\nReceiving a 0 on the assignment/quiz in question.\nReceiving a full letter grade deduction in the course.\nAutomatically failing the course.\n\nDepending on the student’s prior academic history, violations may also be accompanied by a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, again at the instructors’ discretion. This can lead to university-level penalties, such as being suspended or expelled.\n\n\nGrace Period\nCollege is a time when you do a lot of learning. Sometimes, you might make bad decisions or mistakes. The most important thing for you to do is to learn from your mistakes, to constantly grow, and become a better person.\nSometimes, students panic and copy code right before the deadline, then regret what they did afterwards. Therefore, you may rescind any homework submission for up to 24 hours after the deadline with no questions asked. Simply email the course instructors asking to delete the submission in question, and we will do so. Deleted submissions will not be considered during plagiarism detection, though of course they will also not be graded.

    "text": "Academic Integrity Code\nAcademic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one’s own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. For the remainder of the code, see: https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity\nIn addition to the formal code of academic integrity, the instructor expects that students will treat this course with the level of professionalism required in the workplace. Remember that real firms are sponsoring student projects throughout the semester; in a workplace setting, these firms would be paying clients for the analyses being conducted. This course prepares students to succeed in the workplace, and maintaining a high degree of professionalism is expected.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "As inspiration for your final projects, check out these prior exploratory data analyses.\n\nPrevious course showcases\nView here\n\n\nOther exploratory analyses\nSome of these go into further detail than we will cover in this class, but hopefully they will inspire you as you prepare for your own project:\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvivors of the Titantic\nA great overview of getting started with the tidyverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Usain Bolt really the fastest man on earth?\nby Anindya Mozumdar. This analysis uses some statistical modeling (which won’t cover), but the use of visualizations alone are effective for addressing the research questions posed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF1 racing data analysis\nby Jonathan Bouchet. This is an extensive exploratory data analysis of a variety of data on races, drivers, and constructors across the history of Formula 1 racing. This would probably be overkill for a course project, but sections of it (e.g. section 3 on the races, or sections 4 and 5 together on the drivers and constructors) would make a nice project. It involves mutliple data sets, some not-so-simple data cleaning, and a wide variety of nice visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing Intensity of Strong Atlantic Hurricanes\nby James B. Elsner. This is a short analysis with the goal of validating the predictions of this study published in Nature in 2008, which predicted that Atlantic tropical cyclones would continue to get stronger on average over time. While this analysis is too short to be considered adequate for a final project, it is still a good example of good data source documentation and one effective visualization. An expanded inquiry into the questions addressed here would make a good course project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath: Reality vs Reported\nby Owen Shen. This is an interesting original analysis in which the author collected the data himself. The analysis compares whether the proportion of actual causes of death is consistent with the proportion of death causes that the media reports. This analysis also uses some interactive graphics so that the reader can view different versions of the same plot, such as scrolling through the plot over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre first babies more likely to be late?\nby Allen Downey. This is another relatively short analysis, but the author does a good job of documenting his data sources, stating the assumptions he makes, and also describes what data were dropped from the analysis (i.e. babies born via C-section).\n\n\n\n\nHistorically significant analyses\nExploratory data analysis has been around for a very long time. Here are some of the most historically famous.\n\n\n\n\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois’ “The Exhibit of American Negroes”\nIn 1900, W.E.B. Du Bois presented “The Exhibit of American Negroes” at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Du Bois described the exhibition as “Thirty-two charts, 500 photographs, and numerous maps and plans form the basis of this exhibit. The charts are in two sets, one illustrating conditions in the entire United States and the other conditions in the typical State of Georgia.” The charts in his exhibition are staggeringly powerful. This six-part series published in Nightingale displays and discusses many of his impressive visualizations. You can also purchase a book on the portraits on Amazon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinard’s Napoleon March Map\nThe “Napoleon March Map” by Charles Joseph Minard is widely viewed as one of the greatest data visualizations of all time. The chart depicts Napoleon’s disastrous campaign to conquer Moscow. Having started with around 470,000 soldiers, he returned with just 10,000. The width of the line represents the total number of soldiers and the color represents the direction (yellow for towards Moscow, black for the return trip).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTableau’s Top 10 GOAT Data Visualizations\nIt’s hard to say which data visualizations are the “Greatest Of All Time,” but Tableau put together a pretty excellent collection for their top 10 list.",

Your question(s) should be:\n\nClear: it provides enough specifics that your audience can easily understand its purpose without needing additional explanation.\nFocused: it is narrow enough that it can be addressed thoroughly with the data available and within the limits of the final project report.\nConcise: it is expressed in the fewest possible words.\nComplex: it is not answerable with a simple “yes” or “no,” but rather requires synthesis and analysis of data.\nArguable: its potential answers are open to debate rather than accepted facts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBe sure to avoid making causal statments in your research question, such as “how does XX affect YY?” This is a causal question, and causal questions are not appropriate for this course. Instead, we are exploring a topic and looking for patterns in the data. We may find that some things are related, but we cannot say that one thing causes another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlternative project ideas: While most teams choose to conduct a analysis and write a report on their findings, there are two other options for your project:\n\nReplication study: While most teams choose a topic with questions that we don’t yet have answers to, it is also very valuable to conduct replication studies of existing research. If you choose to do this, discuss the original research that you aim to replicate, and note that you still have to look up your own data sources and write your own code.\nDashboard project: A written analysis is the typical final project output, but in some contexts a shiny dashboard can be just as valuable. If you choose to do this, discuss the purpose of the dashboard you have in mind and the data that you plan to include in it. You will still be required to write a report, but the report will motivate the dashboard and key takeaways that can be seen in the dashboard.",

    "text": "EMSE 4572 / 6572Exploratory Data AnalysisFall 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the R programming language. Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using Quarto (which is built on the ideas of RMarkdown). Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nWrite a clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable research question.\nImport, manipulate, clean, visualize, and export data in R.\nWrangle data from its original format into a fit-for-purpose format.\nConduct a systematic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of different types of data.\nApply fundamental principles of visualizing information for exploratory analysis and communication.\nGet data off the web and expose data, code, results on the web.\nGenerate fully reproducible reports that contain code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n\nPrerequisites:\nStudents should have taken EMSE 4571/6571: Intro to Programming for Analytics or have experience working with data in at least one programming language. If you’re not sure whether you have the necessary prerequisite skills, you can try and get up to speed by completing this optional course primer assignment before class starts. Once class starts, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics.",

Most of the time, the raw data you get is in the wrong format and variables are not properly coded, so you will need to “clean” the data before starting any analysis. Other times the data will be split into two or more data sets, and you will need to “join” them together into a single data frame.\nAssessment: This assignment is graded using a check system:\n\n✔+ (110%): Responses shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often.\n✔ (100%): Responses are thoughtful, well-written, and show engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.\n✔− (50%): Responses are hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.\n\nNotice that this is essentially a pass/fail system.

Read & Practice\n\nStat 545 chapter 15 on joining two tables\nTips for Cleaning Messy Data in R\nAlison Hill had an excellent free course on DataCamp called Working with Data in the Tidyverse, but it was unfortunately archived. The content she covered though was made available as a single webpage version that is archived here. The whole course is quite useful for learning some data cleaning skills. In particular, I suggest going through parts 2 (“Tame your data”) and 4 (“Transform your data”) to be best-prepared for dealing with messy real-world data.\nUse AI to Practice Joining Data: Open ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever AI tools you prefer and start a chat to practice the concept of joins. Ask the AI questions about what it gives you to make sure you understand the concept. Are you certain the AI is giving you good code? Play around with it and see if chatting with the AI is helpful. Include the link to your chat in your submission if you have one. Here is an example prompt (feel free to experiment with other prompts):\n\n\nI'm practicing the concept of joining data frames in R. Provide me an example of two datasets that have a common column and then show me R code for how to join them using the tidyverse. Afterwards, show several more slightly more complicated examples where the column names don't align, etc. In each case, explain your reasoning first, then show me the code.\n\n\n\n3. Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your hw2.qmd file, and include at least one question.

Readings\nThis week, I want you to experience some good interactive charts so you can get a sense for how different the user experience is between static and interactive charts.\nTo get started, find an article online that has some interactive charts. I recommend going to The Pudding - almost all of their articles blend text, data, and interactive charts (e.g. check out the article Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive?). Choose an article you find interesting, and feel free to use an article on a different site if you wish.\nOnce you’ve found an article, read through it carefully. As you scroll though it, take note in your reflection this week of some of the key points you remember from the article. Answer these questions:\n\nWhat was one main conclusion or point the author made?\nWere any of the visualizations particularly effective in grabbing your attention and supporting that point?\nWas there anything you could critique about the article or charts you saw?\n\n\n\n3. Turn any ggplot into an interactive chart with ggplotly()\nNow that you’ve seen some interactive charts, make a simple, static chart in the chunk provided in your reflection. It can be any ggplot chart - feel free to copy-paste something we’ve made in class (don’t forget to also copy-paste any data files you may need to create the chart).\nOnce you’ve made your static chart, make it interactive using the ggplotly() function from the plotly package. Simply write code to create your plot, then use ggplotly(plot) to make it interactive. Try it out!\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nggplotly(plot)\n\n\n\n4. Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing?\nWrite at least a paragraph in your hw11.qmd file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.\nSome thoughts you may want to try in your reflection:\n\nWrite about an interesting data visualization about trends you’ve seen.\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\nDiscuss some of the key insights or things you found interesting in the readings or recent class periods.\nConnect the course content to your own work or project you’re working on.\n\n\n\n5.

Focus on things that require coordination across your team, and otherwise work on individual tasks and check each others’ work. Write out your plan by following these guidelines:\n\nRead through the feedback you received from your progress report.\nWrite down a bullet list of goals to achieve for your final report. Consider these questions. If any apply to your team, add that item to your plan:\n\nDo you need to modify your research question?\nDo you need other data sources to address all of the questions you have asked?\nHave you appropriately cleaned / prepared your data?\nAre you unsure about any code you’ve written (e.g. cleaning, joining data, making charts, etc.)? Would it be helpful to have Professor Helveston or one of the class TAs help review your code?\nTeams often separate tasks by person - for your coding tasks, have your other teammates reviewed the code you wrote to check for bugs?\nIs there a particular chart you’ve been working on but haven’t quite yet figured out how to code it up?\nIs there a better version of a chart you want to work on improving?\nIf you’re feeling confident about some parts of the analysis thus far, have you tried polishing up any charts? What can you do to an existing chart to make it communicate a message better?\nReview the content on visualizing information from weeks 6 - 11. Were there any specific types of charts that you think might work well with your project?\n\n\nThese are just some guidelines to consider - there may be other questions to ask yourself.\nYou should come up with your own list an include it here in your reflection. Bring your list with you to class so you can share it with your team. Once your teammates all agree, we can then break out and execute individual tasks towards moving your projects to the finish line!\n\n\n3.

Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using Quarto (which is built on the ideas of RMarkdown). Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through in-class quizzes, reading reflections, and exploratory projects. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course’s topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a 10-minute video presentation of their findings.\nThis course was inspired by many other courses / resources that cover similar material.

Fear not! After completing this assignment, you will be well-prepared to tackle the messiness of real-world data! This assignment will put your data wrangling and cleaning skills to the test and will challenge you to become a master data janitor!\nAssessment: Your submission will be assessed using the rubric at the bottom of this page.\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to clean up a relatively messy data file that contains sales of passenger cars by country between 2019 and 2023. The data are from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA). Your final product should be a tidy (long format) data frame with three columns: country, year, and sales. It should look like this:\nhead(df)\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 3\n#&gt;   country    year   sales\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 Argentina  2019  333183\n#&gt; 2 Australia  2019  799263\n#&gt; 3 Austria    2019  320381\n#&gt; 4 Belgium    2019  550008\n#&gt; 5 Brazil     2019 2262073\n#&gt; 6 Bulgaria   2019   35371\nThat’s the goal - in this assignment, we’ll walk through how to get there step-by-step."

    "text": "Due: Oct 14 by 11:59pm\nWeight: This assignment is worth 10% of your final grade.\nPurpose: When you get a data file to analyze, one of the first things you’ll want to do is explore it. But that’s often easier said than done. The purpose of this assignment is to give you a chance to practice some of the techniques we’ve discussed in class for exploring a data set.\nAssessment: Your submission will be assessed using the rubric at the bottom of this page.\n\n\n1. Get organized\nDownload and unzip this template for your project, then open the report.Rproj file.\nOnce RStudio opens, click on the report.qmd file. That is the primary file you will edit to conduct your analysis.\n\n\n2. Load the data\nFor this assignment, you’ll be exploring data on the costs of hundreds of transit projects around the world collected by the Transit Costs Project. The data span more than 50 countries and totals more than 11,000 km of urban rail built since the late 1990s.\nWrite code to load the transit_cost.csv file in the “data” folder.\n\n\n3. Document the data\n\nFormat: This can just be a single paragraph describing the data sources.\n\nGo to this GitHub page and read about the data we’ll be using (that’s where I got the data in from). In your report.qmd file, document the original data source as well as the source from where you downloaded the data. Note that the GitHub page is not the original data source - it is just a repository where someone else put the data.\n\n\n4. Preview the data\n\nFormat: This can be a mix of code chunks and written text. It is more for you than me - think of this like jotting down notes to help you understand what is in the data.\n\nPreview the data (e.g. using head(), glimpse(), View(), and / or make some quick plots). Take note of what variables are available, their types, and what they measure (Hint: look at the data dictionary on the GitHub page!).\n\n\n5. Identify research questions\n\nFormat: Use a numbered list to list each question and the associated variables you will explore.\n\nOnce you have a sense for the available variables in the data, list at least three questions you think you may be able to answer with these data (you can list more if you want). For each question, also note which variables you plan to explore to address the question. A question can be about what the data captures (e.g. “Which countries in the data have the longest total amount of projects in km?”) or about a relationship between different variables (e.g. “Are projects with tunnels more expensive on a $/km basis than projects without tunnels?”).\nNote: It is okay if you end up not being able to answer your question - just write down what you think you might be able to find out by exploring the data.\n\n\n6. Explore the data\nGo through each of your questions and search for answers. You should include at least one visualization for each question (so a minimum of 3 charts total).\nFor each question, follow these steps:\n\nIf necessary, modify the transit_cost data frame to address your question. For example, you may need to create new variables (e.g. using mutate()), filter the data (e.g. if you’re only interested in a single country, year, etc.), or you may want to rename some of the variables. For this task, you’ll be relying on your data wrangling skills.\nExamine summary measures (centrality, variability, correlation) in the variables relevant to your question by making charts and / or printing out summary values / tables. Your chart(s) should be appropriately chosen according to the data type and / or relationship you are searching for. Your charts should follow the design principles we have covered in class. They do not have to be fully “polished” yet, but at a minimum they should be accurate (i.e. not misleading) and they should not include distracting non-data ink.\nFor each research question, write at least one paragraph describing what you found. If you found an answer to your question, make sure you have included at least one chart (or a few charts if appropriate) that helps explain your answer. If this process did not lead to an answer your question, write about how you might adjust your question or perhaps what other data you may need to address your question.\n\n\n\n7. Render and submit\nClick the “Render” button to compile your .qmd file into a html web page. Then open the report.html file in a web browser and proofread your report.\nDoes all of the formatting look correct? Make sure there are no errors in the rendered file before submitting it.\nOnce you’ve proofread your report, create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.\n\n\nBonus (+3%)\nOne logical relationship you might expect in this data is a strong correlation between the length of a transit line and it’s cost. But if we plot a scatterplot of length and real_cost (making sure to convert real_cost to a number), the correlation doesn’t look too strong. That’s because length and cost don’t scale together in linear space - they scale in log-linear space! That is, the log of these variables correlate much more strongly than the variables themselves. To get the bonus credit, make a plot that shows this relationship (hint: read about log-log plots).\n\n\nGrading Rubric\n\n45 Total Points\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nExcellent\nGood\nNeeds work\n\n\n\n\nFormatting\n5\nFollowed all formatting guidelines.\n4\nFollowed most formatting guidelines.\n3\nMissing multiple formatting guidelines.\n\n\nDocumentation\n5\nOriginal and downloaded data sources clearly described.\n4\nPoor description of original and / or downloaded data sources.\n3\nPoor / unclear / missing description of either original or downloaded data source\n\n\nResearch questions\n10 / 9\nAt least 3 RQs & associated data variables listed.\n8 / 7 / 6\n\n5 / 4 / 3\n\n\n\nExploration\n10 / 9\nSummary measures and charts appropriately used to address all RQs; excellent summary description.\n8 / 7 / 6\nMeasures and charts used to address RQs could be improved; adequate summary description.\n5 / 4 / 3\nMissing summary measures and / or charts to address RQs; poor summary description.\n\n\nVisualizations\n10 / 9\nVisualizations appropriately chosen according to data types and / or relationships.\n8 / 7 / 6\nVisualizations are appropriate but could be improved.\n5 / 4 / 3\nPoor match between visualization and data types / relationships, and / or missing.\n\n\nTechnical things\n5\nAll code runs without errors; all files included in the submitted .zip file.\n4\nCode has only one or two error, otherwise runs; all files included in the submitted .zip file.\n3\nCode has multiple errors; submitted .zip file is missing components necessary to reproduce analysis."

    "text": "Due: Nov 11 by 11:59pm\nWeight: This assignment is worth 10% of your final grade.\nPurpose: At some point in your career, you will likely be involved in creating or revising a summary chart of some data. When that happens, you will also likely be the most knowledge person in the room about what to do to design the chart(s) to effectively communicate the information in the data. This assignment is a practice run for that day.\nAssessment: Your submission will be assessed using the rubric at the bottom of this page.\n\n\nBackground\nThe American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) is a national trade association that advocates for the wind power industry. They also publish data on wind power statistics in the U.S. The authors of this article at howmuch.net got a hold of some of this data and published this unfortunate chart:\n\n \n\n\nFor this assignment, you will use the ggplot2 library in R to redesign the above chart. In this redesign, we are interested in exploring this question:\n\nWhich states are leaders in wind energy?\n\nThe answer depends on what you consider a “leader” to be. For example, the authors of the above chart clearly viewed the installed capacity as the most important metric to highlight. But this chart also contains lots of other data, such as the amount of money each state invested and the number of homes powered by wind in each state. Some states may be leading in other ways, such as the capacity built per dollar of investment.\nWith that in mind, here’s what you need to do for this analysis:\n\n\n1. Get organized\n\nDownload and unzip this template for your project, then open the report.Rproj file.\nOnce RStudio opens, click on the report.qmd file. That is the primary file you will edit to conduct your analysis.\nUpdate the YAML with your name, a title, the date, etc.\nDelete any of the existing text / code in the template before submitting - the template text is just there as a helpful guide.\n\n\nPoints will be taken off for failing to follow these basic organizing steps.\n\n\n\n2. Load the data\nUse this link to download the US_State_Wind_Energy_Facts_2018.xlsx file and put it in your data_raw folder. Here is some information on the data:\nDescription: Data on which US states produce the most wind energy.\nSource of downloaded file: The formatted Excel spreadsheet was downloaded from data.world: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w8\nOriginal source: The primary source is the American Wind Energy Association (https://www.awea.org/), but the source for this particular data was found on this article, which cites the AWEA.\nData dictionary:\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRanking\nRank order of state by installed capacity\n\n\nState\nU.S. state\n\n\nInstalled Capacity (MW)\nInstalled capacity in MW\n\n\nEquivalent Homes Powered\nNumber of homes powered by wind power\n\n\nTotal Investment ($ Millions)\nTotal Investment in $ millions\n\n\nWind Projects Online\nNumber of projects currently online\n\n\n# of Wind Turbines\nNumber of wind turbines in state\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Preview the data\nIn the setup chunk in your report.Rmd file, write code to read in the excel sheet, then write code to preview the data, e.g. using head(), glimpse(), View(), and / or make some quick plots (Hint: look at the top and bottom!). Take note of what variables are available, their types, what they measure, and if there are any missing values. (Hint: Read the data dictionary!) Are all the variables encoded the way you would expect (e.g. are numbers encoded as numbers?)\n\n\n4. Clean the data\n\nWrite code to modify variable types and names to get your data frame cleaned up for analysis. As you do so, I recommend that you modify some of the column names (especially those with spaces in them) to make your analysis easier. (Hint: The clean_names() function from the janitor package is a life saver!)\nWrite a few sentences describing any modifications you made to the original data and why you did it.\n\n\n\n5. Summarize the data\n\nExamine measures of centrality and variability in the important variables relevant to our research question. Remember that we’re interested in the states that are “leaders” in wind energy. While installed capacity is an obvious choice to look at, you should also look at summaries of other values, such as the amount of money invested, and at least two other computed measures, such as the capacity per dollar invested (Note: you’ll need to create new variables to do this!).\nWrite a few sentences explaining your summary measures and what you learned from them.\n\n\n\n6. Visualize the data\n\nCreate an appropriate visualization that highlights leadership in installed capacity. This chart should be a substantial improvement over the original visualization, and it should follow the design principles we have covered in class.\nCreate a second visualization that highlights “leadership” in another metric of your choice. This could be one of the existing variables or a variable you computed. Your chart and design choices should highlight the metric you chose and should have a clear message to convey. Again, this chart should follow the design principles we have covered in class.\n\nYour charts should be polished. Points will be taken off for poor design principles, illegibility, etc.\n\n\n7. Summarize your analysis\nWrite a summary of your analysis process. I’m specifically looking for a discussion of the following:\n\nWhat was wrong with the original chart? Discuss specific design principles we have covered in class.\nDiscuss the improvements your first revised chart makes compared to the original chart.\nDiscuss what message your second chart conveys and what design choices you made to highlight that message.\n\n\n\n8. Render and submit\nClick the “Render” button to compile your .qmd file into a html web page. Then open the report.html file in a web browser and proofread your report.\nDoes all of the formatting look correct? Make sure there are no errors in the rendered file before submitting it.\nOnce you’ve proofread your report, create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.\n\n\nGrading Rubric\n\n45 Total Points\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nExcellent\nGood\nNeeds work\n\n\n\n\nOrganization & Formatting\n5\nData placed in correct folder, read in, and variables have been renamed for ease of use in analysis.\n4\nData not placed in correct folder OR variables were not renamed.\n3\nData not placed in correct folder AND variables were not renamed, or not properly read into R.\n\n\nData Summary\n10 / 9\nMeasures of centrality and variability in appropriate variables are computed; at leaset two new useful measures are computed.\n8 / 7 / 6\nMeasures of centrality and variability in appropriate variables are computed; only one new useful measure computed.\n5 / 4 / 3\nMeasures of centrality and variability missing; failed to compute new measures.\n\n\nData Visualization 1\n10 / 9\nCharts expertly demonstrates best practices of visual design and highlights leadership in installed capacity.\n8 / 7 / 6\nCharts generally demonstrates best practices of visual design and highlights leadership in installed capacity; some elements might be confusing.\n5 / 4 / 3\nChart generally lacks best practices of visual design; elements are confusing, does not highlight leadership in capacity.\n\n\nData Visualization 2\n10 / 9\nCharts expertly demonstrates best practices of visual design and conveys a clear message.\n8 / 7 / 6\nCharts generally demonstrates best practices of visual design and conveys a reasonably clear message; some elements might be confusing.\n5 / 4 / 3\nChart generally lacks best practices of visual design; elements are confusing, does not highlight a clear message.\n\n\nAnalysis Description\n5\nInformative description of flaws in the original chart & their improvements; clear description of revised chart key message.\n4\nDescription of one or two of design flaws in original chart & improvements made; accurate but incomplete description of key message in revised charts.\n3\nPoor description of design flaws in the original chart & improvements made; poor or missing description of key message of revised charts\n\n\nTechnical things\n5\nAll code runs without errors; all files included in the submitted .zip file.\n4\nCode has only one or two error, otherwise runs; all files included in the submitted .zip file.\n3\nCode has multiple errors; submitted .zip file is missing components necessary to reproduce analysis."
